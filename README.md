# Card-Shuffle 
When shuffling a deck of cards it has often been said that performing a "riffle shuffle" is the best method to mix up a deck. I made a python program to see how big of an impact the skill of the shuffler has on the similarity of the shuffled deck when compared to the perfectly shuffled deck.
