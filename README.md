# Card-Shuffle 
A "riffle shuffle" is a certain way of how someone can shuffle a deck of cards. I made a python program to see how big of an impact the component of skill has when shuffling with this method. To learn more about this project you can click [here](https://m-j4k.github.io/Portfolio/Project_CardShuffle.html).


# What I learned
* How to look for insights in data results  
* How to use Matplotlib to plot the results
* Gained more familiarity with python as a whole

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.10.1
* Matplotlib version: 3.5.1
* tdqm version: 4.62.3

# Usage
To run this project, first install the needed libraries if you haven't already.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install matplotlib and/or tdqm:

```

It's possible to create scenario's for your needs. This can be done by making a new case near the beginning of the program. 

It's also adviced to download this program into a new folder in order for the graphs to save there.
